In this example, google Analytics for Firebase was used to get information about the usage and user engagement from application and the log event for each crash that occurs in the application.<br>
The statistics of the application that were taken from Firebase platform are the following:<br>
- Number of active users.<br>
- How much time the users use the application.<br>
- Where users use the application.<br>
- How many users didn´t have any failure in their application.<br>
- Report of the differents types of Android OS that use the application.<br>
- Report for each crash in the application. Getting the trace log and description of the problem.<br>
This Crash Reporting was implemented in all REST clients of the application to monitor the request and response of a HTTP transaction.<br>
